# Canonical backend base URL used across the Web app.
# Change this to your AI Runtime base (e.g., http://ai-runtime.internal:8000)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Note: legacy variables like NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE are no longer used.
# Always prefer NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL and the API_BASE helper at web/lib/api.ts
