- `12_INTERFACE_SYSTEMS_REFACTOR_CONTRACT_2026-02-11.md` is archived into `10`.
- New execution deltas must be appended only to `10`.

## Non-Negotiable Rules
- No mock, placeholder, or fake success.
- If a capability is not validated, it must be treated as NOT_IMPLEMENTED.
- Conflicts between docs must be resolved in favor of this folder.

## Execution Baseline
- MVP (P0) in 4 weeks, v1.0 (P1) in 8 weeks.
- Workbench is the only product shell.
- AI is core, not an add-on.
