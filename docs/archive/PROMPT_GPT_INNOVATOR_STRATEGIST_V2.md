Sell WHAT WE HAVE.

### REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (Markdown Report)

**1. The "Aethel Agents" Feature**

**3. The "Unreal Killer" Visuals**
*   **Source:** `web/lib/aaa-render-system.ts` (SSGI, RayTracing).
*   **Marketing:** "Ray Tracing in the Browser. No Install."
    *   Design a "Quality Toggle" UI that switches between `forward` and `deferred` pipelines defined in the code.

**4. The "Infinite Localization"**
